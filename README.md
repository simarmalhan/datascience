**Ocean Temperature Prediction Using CalCOFI Data**

**Project Overview:**\
This project utilizes the extensive CalCOFI dataset, one of the most comprehensive oceanographic data series, covering over 50,000 sampling stations since 1949. The dataset provides crucial insights into ocean conditions, including temperature, salinity, and biological data, essential for understanding climatic cycles in the California Current and their impacts, such as El Ni√±o.

**Objective:**\
The primary goal of this project is to explore the relationship between salinity and temperature. Using linear regression models, I aimed to predict ocean temperatures based on salinity levels.

**Methodology:**\
- Data Handling: Managed and processed large datasets from the CalCOFI data series.
- Data Cleaning: Performed extensive data cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Model Development: Applied linear regression models to predict ocean temperature based on salinity levels.
- Analysis: Analyzed the correlation between salinity and temperature to draw meaningful conclusions.

**Results:**\
- The project successfully identified correlations between salinity and temperature, demonstrating the potential of predictive modeling in oceanographic studies.

**Technologies Used:**\
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

**Conclusion:**\
This project provided valuable insights into the complex relationship between ocean salinity and temperature, contributing to a deeper understanding of oceanographic patterns.
